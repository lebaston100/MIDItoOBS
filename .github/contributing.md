## Contribuion Guidelines

First off, thanks so much for contributing to the project.

I don't ask for much, but these two things will help a lot:

- Add the Python version and/or the Midi hardware you have tested the script with in your pull request message or edit the bottom part of the readme directly and add it there
- If possible write a little bit about why you did the change and what it does.
- If your pull request contains more then one commit, please squash all the commits together
